###### Des'kansa: <small>(imperative)</small> to rest &mdash; Spanish

A more personally useful take on the traditional [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) project used to test out Javascript frameworks.

This project uses a standard feature set for an HTTP Client, very loosely based on [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/):

- All HTTP Verbs: GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, DELETE, TRACE, OPTIONS, CONNECT, PATCH
- Headers on all requests
- Support for form-data, unencoded form, raw strings, and binary file request bodies on requests that can have bodies
- HTML, XML, and JSON bodies are linted
- Responses are formatted, but not rendered - also available in raw form
- Request history stored in an IndexedDB

## Planned Frameworks

- AngularJS (1.x)
- React
- Vue.js
- Ember.js
- Elm
- Angular (2/4)

## Dependencies

- [Dexie](http://dexie.org) as IndexedDB wrapper
